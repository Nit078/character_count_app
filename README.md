# Character Count Web Application

This web application helps users count the number of characters in their text and provides information on the remaining characters allowed. It is useful for situations where users have a maximum character limit, such as writing bios on social media platforms like Instagram, Twitter, or LinkedIn.

## Features

- **Character Count**: Users can input text into the web application, and the character count dynamically updates to display the number of characters entered.
  
- **Remaining Characters**: The application also shows the number of remaining characters allowed, based on a predefined maximum character limit (e.g., 150 characters).

- **Copy Text**: Users can easily copy the text they've entered to their clipboard with the click of a button. This feature allows users to quickly copy the text and paste it elsewhere, such as into a social media bio field.

## Usage

1. **Input Text**: Type or paste your text into the input field on the web application.

2. **Character Count**: As you type, the character count will dynamically update to reflect the number of characters entered.

3. **Remaining Characters**: The application will also display the number of remaining characters allowed, based on the predefined maximum character limit.

4. **Copy Text**: Click the "Copy Text" button to copy the text to your clipboard. You can then paste it into the desired location, such as a social media bio field.
